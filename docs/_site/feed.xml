        <title>Talking with Robots</title>
        <description>
          
          The heading may seem grammatically incorrect, as we can only talk to robots and not have a 2 way conversation with robots. Read on the article to find out some philosophical ideas of how we can talk with these magnificient machines! The Essence of Engineering According to Wikipedia, engineering is...

        <title>Coverage Algorithms - Part 1</title>
        <description>
          
          Coverage Path Planning is an important area of research in Path Planning for robotics, which involves finding a path that passes through every reachable position in it’s environment. This post discusses a very basic Coverage Algorithm called Random Exploration, it’s implementations and some observations regarding it. Analyzing Coverage Algorithms Classification...

        <title>Virtual Force Algorithms</title>
        <description>
          
          Local Navigation is an important subproblem in the field of Navigation in Robotics. It allows for the robot to break a global path into smaller parts which are effective to navigate through. This article discusses the implementation details of one such algorithm called the Virtual Force Field Algorithm. Self Driving...

        <description>
          
          Time to update to ROS Melodic Ubuntu 18.04 Research on Navigation Being a Computer Science student, and an aspiring engineer; I really like coding and reading about different Algorithms and Data Structures. It was really great when I came to know about this particular algorithm called VFF/Virtual Force Field (Yeah,...

        <title>Way to EDITH</title>
        <description>
          
          Many curious questions left at the end of this week. What is JDERobot exactly? How exactly to use the ICE Framework? Where is it being used in JDERobot? The COOL part! After merging of the pull request, I wanted to solve some other exercise, follow_road. Seeing unknown terms like mavros...
