Automation is the technology by which a process can be carried out with minimal human assistance. Automation can be hardware or software based. In this post we are going to talk about a software based web automation process using the python library Selenium. 


### Selenium and its Functions 
As the name suggests, manipulating data from a web source is called Web Automation. It can include anything like sending emails, messages and even deleting those emails and messages. Automatic Data Scraping is another great example of Web Automation. Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browser through computer program. The automation scripts can be written in various languages, and run for various browsers. All those simple web automation tasks can be simply acheived in minimal amount of code using the Selenium Library.

Possiblities with Selenium are endless! So, let's keep our circle small. We are going to discuss Automatic Whatsapp Messaging, on Google Chrome Browser using Python Language as a test example to use Selenium.

### Installation
First of all, install the python bindings of Selenium. This will make the selenium library ready to be used in our python code.
```bash
pip install selenium
```

Selenium requires a web driver to interface with the chosen browser. A simple google search may yield the required drivers for a particular web browsers. Here are the links for [Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), [FireFox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), Safari[https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/].
